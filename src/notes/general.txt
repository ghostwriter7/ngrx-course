1. ng generate store auth/Auth --module auth.module.ts
2. in dev-tools, after dispatching an action, check 'Action' to see payload
3. simplifying imports - see actions-types.ts
4. select operator - removes any duplicates from the stream
5. selector - keeps last computed value in memory and will reuse it until input (state) changes
6. createFeatureSelector<T>(name) - provides type safe feature selector (instead of state => state.feature)
7. Prevent accidental state mutation by a reducer - implement runtimeChecks (config object of StoreModule.forRoot())
